# Project Recommender System
### Olivier Couque (246212), Emma Lejal Glaude (250692), Matthieu Sauv√© (246243)

This project contains the following elements :
- PDF Report of the Project
- 3 iPython Notebooks: Recommender_Collaborative.ipynb, Recommender_Factorization.ipynb, Recommender_Surprise.ipynb
- 5 python modules : pre_post_process.py, collaborative.py, SGD_helpers.py, bias_helpers.py run.py

_Note_ : in order to do the preprocessing you will need the files "data_train.csv" and "sample_submission.csv" of the Kaggle competition available at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/epfml17-rec-sys

Used Libraries: 
- Surprise: http://surpriselib.com/ All informations about installations are provided at this link (pip install scikit-surprise) and the documentation is really detailed. Our Recommender_Surprise.ipynb notebook, described below, shows a nice and not too complex use of the library.
- Pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/ (pip install pandas or conda install pandas with Anaconda). We only used pandas to load the ratings in a dataframe to be able to use the Surprise.Dataset.load_from_df function that needed a pandas.DataFrame as input.
- Sklearn: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html for the installation. We used this library only to compute the similarities matrices between users in the Recommender_Collaborative.ipynb notebook.
- Numpy / Scipy: https://www.scipy.org/install.html for the installation (already available with Anaconda).
- Seaborn: https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html#installing for the installation. Seaborn was only used to visualize the grid search (for the report).
				
1. Report : this is where you will discover how we tackled the competition. This document explains the preprocessing and every step we took to achieve this current version. It also explains which Machine Learning model we use for the predictions and specify the value of the parameters we used.

2. Notebooks : 

	- Recommender_Collaborative.ipynb: Notebook using the User - user collaborative filtering technique. Here are the following steps of the notebook:
		
		1. Load the data, divide the ratings matrix in training and testing set.
		2. Statistics on the dataset
		3. Presentation of the algorithm used: similarity metrics, how to compute the predictions
		4. Find best parameters (similarity matrix and number K of best neighbors to keep for each user) by running the algorithm numerous times with different parameters: train on training ratings and test on testing ratings with RMSE.
		5. Compute the wanted predictions on the whole ratings (no test), using the algorithm with the best found parameters.
		6. Creation of csv file for the submission.
	
	- Recommender_Factorization.ipynb:
	
		1. Load the data, Divide the ratings matrix in training and testing set.
		2. Basic Matrix Factorization: 
		- find best parameters, first the learning rate gamma, then the regularizers and number of features with grid search.	
		- compute the SGD on the whole ratings matrix with best found parameters
		- compute the predictions with the user features and item features found with SGD
		3. Biased Matrix Factorization: 
		- Convert training and testing ratings in the biased training ratings and biased testing ratings
		- Run same steps of Basic Matrix Factorization on the biased training ratings and biased testing ratings
		- compute the predictions with user features, item features found with SGD, overall mean, bias of users and bias of items
		4. Setting the predictions below 1.0 to 1.0 and those above 5.0 to 5.0 (just a few of them)
		5. Creation of csv file for the submission
	
	- Recommender_Surprise.ipynb: Notebook using the Surprise library for building and analyzing recommender systems. Here are the following steps of the notebook:
		
		1. Load the data in a pandas dataframe. Create the ratings matrix from the dataframe using Surprise.
		2. Initialize and run a grid search to find the best parameters with cross validation (5 folds) using the library.
		3. Run the matrix factorization algorithm (called SVD in Surprise which actually is the biased matrix factorization using SGD) on the full ratings with the best parameters giving the minimal previous testing loss. 
		4. Predict the wanted ratings given the user ids and item ids
		5. Creation of csv file for the submission

    - run.py : This module executes the program in order to get our best submission from the Kaggle competition -> it takes some time to compute (hours) because we are running a grid search by keeping the features matrices giving the minimal loss at each new iteration (warm start) but you will see prints on the terminal as indications.
			   It is commented such that you understand each step we did to obtain the predictions for the best submission.
			   Do not worry about the RunTime warnings when running the run.py.
			   You may change the path of the "data_train.csv" and "sample_submission.csv" files in the load_data(path) function.

To run the run.py module :
- On Mac : open the Terminal, enter your path to the folder where the Python modules are, enter the following command : chmod +x run.py. To execute enter : python run.py
- On Windows: open the Terminal, enter your path to the folder where the Python modules are. To execute enter : python run.py
